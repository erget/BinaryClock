BinaryClock
===========

Implementations of binary clocks, both as a hardware prototype for a standalone
device and for the Raspberry Pi with an LED array.

Install with:

    sudo make install

This will compile the software and install it, if needed. It will also install
and register the hardware clock drivers so that they start when the Pi boots.
After rebooting the Pi it will use the hardware clock to set its internal
clock.
The Makefile assumes that the following real time clock module is used:

If you are using a hardware clock that has not been set and the Pi has no
internet connection, the clock will not know what time it is and thus need to
be set. You can do this with the UNIX ``date`` utility and then set the
hardware clock to the system time with the following command:

    sudo hwclock -w

Afterwards the clock will be set correctly.
