BinaryClock 1.0.0
=================

Implementations of binary clocks, both as a hardware prototype for a standalone
device and for the Raspberry Pi with an LED array. A full description of the
library, how to build the device physically, and suggestions on how to extend
it are available here:

Install with:

    sudo make install

This will compile the software and install it, if needed. It will also install
and register the hardware clock drivers so that they start when the Pi boots.
After rebooting the Pi it will use the hardware clock to set its internal
clock.
The Makefile assumes that the following real time clock module is used:

The installation will only take effect after you reboot.

If you are using a hardware clock that has not been set and the Pi has no
internet connection, the clock will not know what time it is and thus need to
be set. You can do this with the UNIX ``date`` utility and then set the
hardware clock to the system time with the following command:

    sudo hwclock -w

Afterwards the clock will be set correctly.

The program works by parsing a string, converting it into colors and setting
the corresponding pixels in the LED array to those colors. For details see the
source code.
